# BioInfoJava-Utils

**BioInfoJava-Utils**  is a modular Java library providing high-performance implementations of core bioinformatics algorithms, such as distance matrix computation and phylogenetic tree construction from **VCF** and **FASTA** files.

This library serves as the computational backend for the [`fastreeR`](https://github.com/gkanogiannis/fastreeR) software suite, which offers a flexible and user-friendly interface to these tools across multiple platforms and environments.

## Integration and Accessibility

The functionality of **BioInfoJava-Utils** is exposed through the [`fastreeR`](https://github.com/gkanogiannis/fastreeR) interface, which is accessible in the following ways:

* ‚úÖ **Python CLI**: through a lightweight [Python wrapper](https://github.com/gkanogiannis/fastreeR/blob/devel/fastreeR.py) that calls the Java backend via `subprocess`
* ‚úÖ **Bioconda**: install with `conda install -c bioconda fastreer`
* ‚úÖ **PyPI**: install with `pip install fastreer`
* ‚úÖ **Docker**: available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/gkanogiannis/fastreer) and [GHCR](https://ghcr.io/gkanogiannis/fastreer) for containerized execution
* ‚úÖ **R / Bioconductor**: via the [`fastreeR`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/fastreeR) package using `rJava`
* ‚úÖ **Pure Java API**: developers can integrate this library directly in Java-based pipelines or software.

## Overview

**BioInfoJava-Utils** provides efficient, scalable, and parallel implementations of widely used bioinformatics algorithms. It is designed for processing large-scale genomic datasets efficiently, supporting both research and production environments.

## Features

* ‚öôÔ∏è Compute sample-wise **distance matrices** from VCF (cosine) or FASTA (D2S) files
* üå≥ Build **phylogenetic trees** using neighbor-joining algorithm
* üß¨ Support for **hierarchical clustering** with dynamic tree pruning
* üîÑ **Multithreaded** processing for large input files
* üì¶ Integrates seamlessly into diverse environments (R, Python, Docker, Java)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
